product_description: So I start a revolution from my bed 'Cause you said the
  brains I had went to my head Step outside, summertime's in bloom Stand up
  beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna
  burn my heart out And so, Sally can wait She knows it's too late as we're
  walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger, I heard you
  say
