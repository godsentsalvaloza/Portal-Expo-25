sculpture_name: Flow of Devotion
sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Paper, Cardboard, Stick, Glue, Lace,
  Styro</i><br><br>The pamaypay, or fan, is often used during the Sinulog
  Festival by dancers and devotees. It helps show graceful movements and keeps
  people cool during long parades. For our sculpture, we made a 2-foot fan using
  papier-mâché, which we created by layering paper and glue to form the shape.
  We designed one side using abstract art inspired by artists like Theo van
  Doesburg and Paul Klee, with colorful shapes and lines. The other side uses
  optical art (Op Art) with black-and-white patterns that create a moving effect
  when viewed. We chose these styles to give the fan a modern and creative look
  while still showing respect for tradition. We also used simple layering and
  outlining techniques to make the main parts stand out. Through this artwork,
  we want to show that even in a changing world, traditions like Sinulog still
  bring people together.
