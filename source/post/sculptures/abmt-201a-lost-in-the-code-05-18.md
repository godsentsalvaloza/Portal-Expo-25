sculpture_name: Lost in the Code
sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Paper Maché, Cardboard, Acrylic Paint,
  Spray Paint</i><br><br>This paper mâché sculpture is inspired by the Maskara
  Festival but shown in a modern, futuristic way. Unlike the usual smiling
  masks, this one has a blank, emotionless face to show how people can slowly
  lose their real emotions because of too much technology and social media, with
  the robot-like parts and dark colors representing how technology is becoming a
  bigger part of our lives. This artwork shows the mix of tradition and modern
  life, and how it can change who we are inside.
