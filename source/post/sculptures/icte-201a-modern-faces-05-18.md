sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Cardboard, Acrylic
  Paint</i><br><br>Inspired by the Masskara festival, through the festival's
  iconic smiling masks, it symbolizes resilience and positivity, earning Bacolod
  City its famous nickname. Taking place every October, the festival invites
  everyone to celebrate life, dance, and indulge in the city's infectious cheer,
  reminiscent of Brazil's Rio Carnival. Our mask is created using cardboard
  boxes, newspapers, and acrylic paint to put on our mask. Our work represents
  how technology is slowly integrating in our lives through the
  mask.<br><br>Covering most of its design with the colour blue, it portrays
  serenity, stability, inspiration, and wisdom. The smiling masks are a
  declaration of the city’s resilience and jubilant spirit, with the festival a
  testament to the local people’s ability to turn adversity into a source of
  pride and joy. The masks are more than just accessories; they are an art form
  that tells a story with each handcrafted detail.
