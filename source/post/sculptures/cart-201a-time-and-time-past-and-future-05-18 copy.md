sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Carton, Paper Maché, Acrylic Paints,
  Cardboard</i><br><br>The sculpture themed massakara festival represents a time
  traveler’s journey through eras, with the brown, steampunk-inspired figure on
  the left symbolizing the past—adorned with Baybayin script, gears, clocks,
  feathered, and floral motif elements reminiscent of ancient creativity and
  mechanical innovation. On the other side, a futuristic counterpart emerges in
  striking blue, silver, and blue tones, showcasing modern technology, robotic
  motifs, and streamlined designs reflective of a highly advanced future.
  Between these two contrasting figures lies an invisible space a symbolic
  wormhole that bridges centuries, marking the portal through which the traveler
  cut-across time itself.
