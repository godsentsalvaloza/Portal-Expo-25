sculpture_name: Kadayawan Fruit Generated Basket
sculpture_description: Some fruits are inspired by Genetically Engineered
  fruits. The Kadayawan Festival took its pride with their Fruit Basket which
  showcases lots of fruits from their culture and province. It is evident that
  some fruits are shaped robotically to highlight how Genetically Engineered
  fruits differ from the naturally produced ones.
