sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft x 4ft<br><i>Paper Maché, Acrylic
  Paints</i><br><br>A sculpture of a Carabao from the “Kneeling Carabao
  Festival” that has a touch of futuristic elements, where its body is
  intertwined with wires, giving the appearance of the Carabao being slowly
  transformed into a cybor. The sculpture captures the Carabao in its
  traditional kneeling pose, with the wires appearing as if they’re infecting
  its form, merging organic and mechanical elements in a dramatic fusion.
