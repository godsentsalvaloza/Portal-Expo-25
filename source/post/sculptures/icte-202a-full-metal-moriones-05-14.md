sculpture_description: >-
  2025<br>2ft<br><i>Paper, Barbeque Stick, Cardboard, Folder,
  Cartolina</i><br><br>

  This sculpture replicates that of the "Moriones" from the Moriones Festival who are furnished with garb of biblical imperial Roman Soldiers. The Moriones are embedded with embellishments of futurism, coated with paper mache-interpreted metal instead of its traditional counterpart. The futuristic Moriones soldier paper mache sculpture reimagines the traditional centurion of the Philippine Holy Week with a sci-fi twist. Blending cultural heritage with futuristic armour aesthetics to symbolise the combination of past devotion and future innovation.
