sculpture_name: Modern Mask, Traditional Spirit
sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Cardboard, Crepe Paper, Colored Paper,
  Newspaper</i><br><br>This colourful cultural mask display was created by the
  artists using paint and sustainable resources like cardboard and old papers.
  Several emotive faces with symbolic patterns are included into the artistic
  design, and the extension areas are represented by plumed feathers painted in
  red, yellow, and blue. Traditional tribal masks and ideas of identity and
  cultural expression through community involvement form the creative basis of
  this project. The artworkâ€™s several faces each express a variety of human
  emotions and cultural beliefs, yet its vibrant feather decorations give it a
  joyful vibe. This exhibit makes a statement in public gatherings like parades
  and festivals, entertaining spectators and educating them about the customs of
  different indigenous groups.
