sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Paper Maché, and Acrylic
  Paint</i><br><br>This Ati-Atihan-inspired paper mâché sculpture, titled
  "Neo-Kalibo," features a vibrant, fan-shaped headdress painted in deep purple,
  decorated with geometric patterns such as diamonds, triangles, and a stylized
  sunburst. These shapes are rendered in neon red, yellow, and orange, blending
  tribal heritage with a futuristic aesthetic. The neck area is detailed with
  circuit-inspired designs, while the base is adorned with a lively
  multi-colored fringe, echoing the festive energy of the Ati-Atihan Festival in
  a modern, tech-influenced style.
