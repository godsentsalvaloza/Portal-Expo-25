sculpture_description: 2025<br>2ft<br><i>Carton, Newspaper, Magazine, Manila
  Paper, Acrylic Paint, Silver Spray</i><br><br>This features an AI robot
  immersing itself in the vibrant Masskara Festival, interpreting the
  celebration in its own unique way. The clock in the background represents the
  intersection of technology and tradition, with its hands poised near 12,
  hinting at a duality - perhaps the end of one cycle and the start of another,
  or the threshold between binary code and human experience.
