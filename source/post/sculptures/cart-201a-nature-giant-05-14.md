  2025<br>2ft<br><i>Paper Maché, Acrylic Paint, Carton</i><br><br>

  Nature’s Giant is a monumental sculpture that honors the enduring spirit of Mother Nature. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant Higantes Festival of the Philippines, this piece is crafted entirely from paper, glue, and other organic materials celebrating sustainability and the rich tradition of paper-mâché art. Cloaked in radiant gold, the figure bridges the gap between past and present, tradition and innovation. The golden finish evokes both reverence and modernity, symbolizing nature’s immeasurable value in an age of rapid technological change. Nature’s Giant stands not only as a cultural tribute but as a reminder of our responsibility to protect and cherish the natural world.
