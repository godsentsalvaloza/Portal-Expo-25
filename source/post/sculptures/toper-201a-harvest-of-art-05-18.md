  This mango sculpture is a tribute to the heart of the Manggahan Festivalâ€”celebrating the mango as a symbol of abundance, unity, and cultural pride. The bold patterns reflect the strength and resilience of the Filipino spirit, rooted in tradition and community. As the festival honors the harvest, this artwork serves as a reminder of the shared joy and heritage that bloom each season. It stands not just as a fruit, but as a vibrant emblem of life and identity.
