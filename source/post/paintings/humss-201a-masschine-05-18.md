art_name: Masschine
art_description: Inspired by the Masskara Festival, the Masschine painting
  circulates around the possibility of maintaining its tradition while also
  being carried away by the innovation. The Maskaras and costumes were made by
  LED lights, signifying the modernity of the tradition. While the painting
  honors the relevance of Masskara Festival on the culture and tradition of the
  people, it still wants to show that there may come a possibility that it can
  be replaced by machines.
