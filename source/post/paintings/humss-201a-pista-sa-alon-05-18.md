art_description: 2025<br> 12" x 12" <br> <i>Acrylic on Canvas</i><br><br>This
  colorful painting shows the Bangus Festival, a lively celebration in Dagupan
  City. At the center is a stylized milkfish (called bangus) swimming through
  bright blue and green waves. The bold lines and fun colors show the excitement
  and pride of the festival, which honors Dagupanâ€™s famous fish. The flowing
  shapes feel like dancing, symbolizing tradition, joy, and togetherness.
