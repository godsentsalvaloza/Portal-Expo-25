art_description: This colorful painting shows the Bangus Festival, a lively
  celebration in Dagupan City. At the center is a stylized milkfish (called
  bangus) swimming through bright blue and green waves. The bold lines and fun
  colors show the excitement and pride of the festival, which honors Dagupanâ€™s
  famous fish. The flowing shapes feel like dancing, symbolizing tradition, joy,
  and togetherness.
