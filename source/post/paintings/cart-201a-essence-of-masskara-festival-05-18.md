art_description: "2025<br> 12\" x 12\" <br> <i>Acrylic on
  Canvas</i><br><br>Digital Smiles: Maskara Festival in the Age of Innovation
  This artwork reimagines the vibrant spirit of the Maskara Festival by fusing
  its iconic, colorful masks and jubilant street scenes with elements of modern
  technology. The traditional smiling faces-symbols of resilience and hope from
  Bacolod’s City of Smiles-are intertwined with digital motifs: LED-lit
  patterns, augmented reality overlays, and sleek, futuristic materials. Neon
  hues and interactive displays evoke the festival’s energy, while hints of
  virtual connectivity and wearable tech reflect how technology now amplifies
  cultural celebrations, the globe hologram also symbolizes the world's fast
  innovation with technology, making them more immersive and accessible to a
  global audience. This fusion honors the festival’s heritage while embracing
  innovation, illustrating how tradition and technology can coexist to create
  new forms of artistic expression and community connection."
