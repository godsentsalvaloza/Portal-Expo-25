  The Sinulog Festival is a special celebration held every January in Cebu to honor the Santo Ni√±o or Child Jesus. It is one of the most famous festivals in the Philippines, known for its street dancing, music, and colorful costumes. People join parades and dance to the beat of the drums as a way to show their joy and faith. In our painting, we used acrylic paint to show the bright and lively feeling of the event. We painted dancers, decorations, and festive lights to represent the happy atmosphere. To connect it to modern life, we added designs like cellphones, LED lights, and digital patterns. These details show how technology is now part of everyday celebrations.
