art_name: "Bloom Beyond Colors "
art_description: '2025<br> 12" x 12" <br> <i>Acrylic on Canvas</i><br><br>This
  painting is a vibrant tribute to the Panagbenga Festival, a celebration of
  blooming, culture, and community held annually in Baguio City. At the heart of
  the artwork is a flower adorned jeepney, symbolizing the journey of Filipino
  life, resilient, enduring, and deeply rooted in tradition. The flowers that
  surround it, both dull and vibrant, represent the duality of human experience:
  the muted blooms reflect struggles and darker days, while the brighter ones
  symbolize joy, hope, and the lively spirit of the festival, Both the vibrant
  and muted colors represent that, whether in our darkest or brightest days, we
  continue to bloom and reveal our true selves with strength and authenticity.
  The rainbow patterns In the background illustrate the range of emotions felt
  during this season of renewal, expressing how the festival brings people
  together in a shared moment of beauty, healing, and celebration. Traditional
  Cordillera textile patterns beneath the scene ground the piece in indigenous
  heritage, honoring the rich cultural roots of the region. Altogether, the
  painting captures the essence of Panagbengaâ€”not just as a visual feast, but as
  a heartfelt journey of growth, resilience, and cultural pride.'
