art_name: Radiance Of Masskara
art_description: 2025<br> 12" x 12" <br> <i>Acrylic on Canvas</i><br><br> The
  painting, made using canvas, acrylic paint, brush, pen, and palette, was
  created in reference to the Masskara Festival celebrated in Bacolod City.
  Entitled "Radiance of Masskara", the piece presents how the ethnic culture of
  the Filipino continues to shine brightly even as the world progresses. It
  illustrates traditional dancers in their colorful masks performing in the
  streets, while also incorporating elements of modern society—such as flying
  drones, high-rise buildings, and new model jeeps. This fusion of traditional
  and contemporary imagery captures the essence of how Filipinos preserve their
  culture of joy despite constant societal changes. The choreography in the
  painting—expressed through dynamic brushstrokes and vivid colors—depicts the
  dancers’ hopeful energy, symbolizing the enduring spirit of the Filipino
  people. The presence of modern technology and towering structures does not
  clash with the cultural celebration but rather emphasizes its adaptability.
  "Radiance of Masskara" symbolizes strength, resilience, and hope—showing how
  the Filipino spirit continues to smile and shine, even through challenging
  times, while looking forward to a brighter future.
