research_title: "CULTURAL TOURISM: THE IMPACT OF FOOTWEAR DURABILITY IN MARIKINA
  MARKET ON CUSTOMERS SATISFACTION AMONG SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT STI
  COLLEGE MARIKINA"
research_abstract: This study examines the impact of Marikina footwear
  durability on customer satisfaction among Senior High School students at STI
  College Marikina. It focuses on how craftsmanship, longevity, and value for
  money influence purchasing decisions and brand loyalty. The research is based
  on hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis suggests no significant
  connection between durability and satisfaction, while the alternative
  hypothesis highlights its importance. The study uses a descriptive survey
  approach, with structured questionnaires given to students who have bought
  Marikina footwear. The questionnaires collected data on demographics,
  durability (such as performance in wet conditions and long-term quality), and
  satisfaction (including comfort, style, and price relative to durability).
  Ethical guidelines, such as informed consent and data anonymization, were
  strictly followed. The findings show that durability significantly affects
  satisfaction, with students valuing longevity and resilience as key factors in
  their perception of value. However, comfort and affordability also play
  important roles, revealing a complex relationship between product durability
  and overall user experience. While students appreciate Marikina's artisanal
  heritage, concerns about declining craftsmanship and competition with cheaper,
  mass-produced imports highlight challenges facing the industry. The study
  concludes that improving durability, along with addressing comfort and cost,
  can boost customer loyalty and restore Marikina's reputation as the "Shoe
  Capital of the Philippines." Recommendations include fostering youth-driven
  innovation, expanding vocational training, and emphasizing durability in
  marketing strategies as a key selling point.
