research_title: " WEBCRAFT: A WEB-BASED LEARNING  TOOL IN STI COLLEGE MARIKINA "
research_abstract: The purpose of our research paper is to analyze how effective
  and how useful our learning tool WebCraft is to all Senior High School
  Students here in STI College Marikina. Our system or learning tool was created
  to teach and help students with the use of basic programming languages such as
  HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Our Statement of the Problem, on the other hand, was
  based on the students who lack knowledge and understanding of programming.
  Therefore we researchers came up with the decision to create a web-based
  programming learning tool to help them understand how programming works and
  functions and provided research questions to check how effective and useful it
  is for the students when they first try to use our learning tool. Furthermore,
  we also came up with this kind of decision to create this learning
  tool because according  to Josué et al., 2023 on our Foreign Literature,
  Digital tools or Elearning tools are a useful tool to help improve the
  teaching-learning process even more better and productive with the use of
  electronic devices such as smartphones and computers and provide modules,
  discussions and assignments through online instead. To answer the
  effectiveness and usefulness of our learning tool, We the researchers used
  Quantitative Research Method and utilized Survey Questionnaires to our
  dear respondents randomly by the use of Simple Random Sampling Technique in
  order to gather numerical data using Mean and Percentage distribution and (4)
  four point likert scale as our Statistical Tool to fully analyze responses
  from all qualified sample Likert scale where given interpretations 4 (3.50 -
  4.00) stands for Very Satisfactory, 3 (2.50 - 3.49) stands for Satisfactory, 2
  (1.50 - 2.49) stands for Poor and 1 (1 - 1.49) stands for Very Poor in order
  to analyze how effective and useful our learning tool for all Senior High
  School Students in STI College Marikina. In this case, The Results
  were somewhat satisfying and helpful based on our weighted mean and analysis
  thanks to our interactive web-based learning tool. Further, the findings of
  this study could be useful for all students who wish to learn how to be more
  productive and capable at computer programming with the use of the learning
  tool’s interactive lessons and instructions in order to enhance their
  knowledge and skills when it comes to computer programming. And finally, our
  first conclusion for this study is that the learning tool that we shared and
  provided for all Senior High School Students positively and significantly
  improved knowledge and understanding about computer programming and our second
  conclusion for this study is with all of our efforts to create and
  conduct research about our learning tool, we researchers hope that this
  learning tool will help enhance students’ knowledge and understanding about
  basic computer programming even more in the future. With the results, Upon
  gathering data by utilizing survey questionnaires towards our respondents, 20%
  of them was Grade 11 Students with ICTE101A having 10% responses and ABM101A
  having 10% responses towards our survey questionnaires and 80% of them was
  Grade 12 Students with ICTE201P and ICTE202P both having 5% responses, ABM201A
  having 10% responses, HUMSS201A having 25% responses, CART201A having the same
  25% responses and TOPE201A having 10% responses with 79% of them were
  interested in programming while 21% of them have no interests at programming.
  Furthermore, We have the Grade 11 Respondents’ Answers from Statement of the
  Problem 2.1 titled “The user experience of “WebCraft” in learning 
  programming”, starting from Statement of the Problem 2.2 “How easy is it for
  you to navigate the web app?” having a 70% Very Satisfactory level and 30%
  Satisfactory level with a total of 56 Very Satisfactory level, 18 Satisfactory
  level and weighted mean of 3.70%, while at the Statement of the Problem 2.3
  “Are you contented in the overall design looks of the web?” having a 60% Very
  Satisfactory level, 35% Satisfactory level and 5% Poor level with a total of
  48 Very Satisfactory level, 21 Satisfactory level, 2 Poor level and weighted
  mean of 3.55% and finally, The Statement of the Problem 2.4 “How useful the
  web app in frontend programming related matters” having a 65% Very
  Satisfactory level and 35% Satisfactory level with a total of 52 Very
  Satisfactory level, 21 Satisfactory level and weighted mean of 3.65% based on
  the total of 20% respondents and having a Visual Interpretation of Very
  Satisfactory. Finally, We also have Grade 12 Respondents’ Answers within the
  Same Statement of the Problem 2.1 also titled “The user experience of
  “WebCraft” in learning  programming”, starting from Statement of the Problem
  2.2 “How easy is it for you to navigate the web app?” having a 37.5% Very
  Satisfactory level, 57.5% Satisfactory level and 5% Poor level with a total of
  120 Very Satisfactory level, 138 Satisfactory level, 8 Poor level and weighted
  mean of 3.32%, while at Statement of the Problem 2.3 “Are you contented in the
  overall design looks of the web?” having a 40% Very Satisfactory level, 55%
  Satisfactory level and 5% Poor level with a total of 128 Very Satisfactory
  level, 132 Satisfactory level, 8 Poor level and weighted mean of 3.35% and
  finally, The Statement of the Problem 2.4 “How useful the web app in frontend
  programming related matters” having a 50% Very Satisfactory level, 47.5%
  Satisfactory level and 2.5% Poor level with a total of 160 Very
  Satisfactory level, 114 Satisfactory level and 4 Poor level and weighted mean
  of 3.47% based on the total of 80% respondents and having a Visual
  Interpretation of Satisfactory. Finally, We have the Grade 11 Respondents from
  Statement of the Problem 3.1 titled “The effectiveness of the learning tool
  “WebCraft” to engage in learning progress”, starting from Statement of the
  Problem 3.2 “The WebCraft helped improve my understandings and knowledge about
  frontend programming specifically html.” having a 70% Very Satisfactory level
  and 30% Satisfactory level with a total of 56 Very Satisfactory level, 18
  Satisfactory level and weighted mean of 3.70%, while at Statement of the
  Problem 3.3 “The WebCraft helped improved my understandings and knowledge
  about frontend  programming specifically CSS” having a 55% Very Satisfactory
  level and 45% Satisfactory level with a total of 44 Very Satisfactory level,
  27 Satisfactory level and weighted mean of 3.55% and finally, The Statement of
  the Problem 3.4 “The WebCraft helped improved my understandings and knowledge
  about frontend programming specifically JS” having a 60% Very Satisfactory
  level and 40% Satisfactory level with a total of 48 Very Satisfactory level
  and 24 Satisfactory level and weighted mean of 3.60% based on our total of 20%
  respondents and having a Visual Interpretation of Very Satisfactory. And
  lastly, We also have the Grade 12 Respondents’ Answers within the same
  Statement of the Problem 3.1 also titled “The effectiveness of the learning
  tool “WebCraft” to engage in learning progress”, starting from Statement of
  the Problem 3.2 “The WebCraft helped improve my understandings and knowledge
  about frontend programming specifically html.” having a 43% Very Satisfactory
  level, 55% Satisfactory level and 2% Poor level with a total of 136 Very
  Satisfactory level, 88 Satisfactory level, 4 Poor level and weighted mean of
  2.85%, while at Statement of the Problem 3.3 “The WebCraft helped improved my
  understandings and knowledge about frontend programming specifically CSS”
  having a 50% Very Satisfactory level, 46% Satisfactory level and 4% Poor level
  with a total of 160 Very Satisfactory level, 111 Satisfactory level, 6 Poor
  level and weighted mean of 3.46% and finally, The Statement of the Problem 3.4
  “The WebCraft helped improved my understandings and knowledge about frontend
  programming specifically JS” having a 40% Very Satisfactory level, 54%
  Satisfactory level, 5% Poor level and 1% Very Poor level with a total of 128
  Very Satisfactory level, 129 Satisfactory level, 4 Poor level, 1 Very
  Poor level and weighted mean of 3.33% based on our total of 80% respondents
  and having a Visual Interpretation of Satisfactory level. Therefore, our
  result for teaching students using our learning tool “WebCraft” is somewhat
  satisfactory based on our weighted mean scale because some of the respondents,
  especially Grade 11 and Grade 12 Students who answered poor and one did answer
  very poor.
