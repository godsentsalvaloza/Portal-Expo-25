research_title: "Assessing Customer Level Satisfaction of Seaweed Bread Among
  Senior High School Students of STI College Marikina "
research_abstract: "This study assess the satisfaction levels of senior high
  school students at STI College Marikina towards seaweed bread, a healthy and
  innovative food alternative to regular bread. As functional foods become
  increasingly popular, seaweed is unique for its health advantages and
  ecological friendliness. The study is focused on three aspects: uniqueness,
  expectations, and satisfaction as a whole. A mix survey of 100 students from
  Grade 11 and 12 was carried out to acquire knowledge on their experience with
  seaweed bread. According to the findings, the majority of students were
  impressed by it being unique and tasty, but opinions were mixed about it being
  salty or not. Many respondents were contented with its appearance and were
  willing to recommend it to others.These results point to the market potential
  of seaweed bread and indicate that minor adjustments, especially in harmony of
  the flavor, would be enough to improve consumer acceptance. This research adds
  to food innovation through the promotion of healthier and more sustainable
  eating habits."
