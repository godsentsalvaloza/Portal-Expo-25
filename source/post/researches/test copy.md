research_title: ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SIM APP WITH INTERACTIVE ROOM MAPS FOR THE TEACHERS OF STI COLLEGE MARIKINA
research_abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of the STI Integrated Map (SIM) application in assisting teachers at STI College Marikina with classroom navigation and scheduling. It aims to address scheduling conflicts and room availability issues through an interactive digital mapping system. Using a descriptive quantitative approach, data was gathered from faculty members via structured survey questionnaires and cluster sampling to assess user experience and satisfaction. Following the Input-Process-Output (IPO) framework, the study identifies scheduling challenges (input), implements the SIM app (process), and enhances faculty collaboration and classroom management (output). The system framework details how real-time data integration improves room monitoring. The treatment involved testing the appâ€™s usability in checking room availability and managing schedules. Results show that the SIM app significantly improves classroom management by providing real-time room availability, enhancing collaboration, and minimizing scheduling conflicts. Most respondents found it user-friendly and efficient. Further research is recommended to explore features like administrative access and personalized scheduling.
