research_title: ASSESSING CUSTOMER ACCEPTABILITY AND PALATABILITY OF MUSHROOM
  NUGGETS AMONG GRADE 12 SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS OF STI COLLEGE MARIKINA
research_abstract: Mushrooms are well known for their nutritional value and
  meat-like texture, making them a popular plant-based substitute for
  traditional meat products. As consumers seek healthier and more sustainable
  dietary options, there is a growing interest in developing meat substitutes
  that are both nutritious and flavorful. However, consumer taste and texture
  preferences may vary, making acceptance of such alternatives difficult. This
  study assesses the students' preferences for mushroom nuggets at STI College
  Marikina, focusing on their taste, texture, and overall satisfaction with the
  product. The researchers used a descriptive type of survey design for the 100
  randomly selected Grade 12 students from CART, TOPE, HUMSS, ABM, and ICT
  strands to gather information on the acceptability and palatability of
  mushroom nuggets. The fishbowl method was used to conduct random sampling.
  Respondents first tasted the mushroom nuggets and then score their
  satisfaction level in relation to the research questions where Likert scale is
  utilized to measure their level of acceptability & palatability. Findings
  indicate that 98.77% of students found the mushroom nuggets acceptable, with
  taste receiving the highest rating (3.80 weighted mean, Strongly Agree),
  followed by aroma and appearance (3.49 weighted mean, Agree). These results
  confirm that mushroom nuggets have strong potential as a plant based
  alternative that meets consumer expectations. Given the positive response,
  this study suggests that mushroom nuggets could be introduced into meal
  programs and commercial markets as a nutritious and eco-friendly choice.
  Further research on nutritional value, large-scale production, and market
  demand is recommended to enhance the product and promote wider acceptance.
