research_title: Service Quality of McDonald's Concepcion Uno, Marikina City
  towards Customer Satisfaction among Grade 12 SHS Students at STI College
  Marikina
research_abstract: "This study examines the service quality of McDonald's
  Concepcion Uno, Marikina City, and its impact on customer satisfaction among
  Grade 12 SHS students at STI College Marikina. The research focuses on three
  key service quality factors: tangibility (cleanliness, ambiance, facilities),
  reliability (order accuracy), and responsiveness (staff attentiveness and wait
  times). Using a quantitative research approach, data was gathered from Grade
  12 students through a survey, analyzing their dining frequency, experiences
  with service speed, and overall satisfaction. The findings reveal that most
  respondents visit McDonald's occasionally (1–3 times a month), with younger
  customers (ages 17–18) making up the majority. While customers generally rate
  cleanliness, staff politeness, and order accuracy positively, long wait times,
  especially during peak hours, remain a concern. The study concludes that
  improving service responsiveness such as reducing wait times, enhancing staff
  efficiency, and optimizing order processing can further improve customer
  satisfaction and loyalty. Based on these findings, recommendations are
  provided for McDonald's management, restaurant staff, future researchers, and
  other fast-food chains to enhance service quality and meet customer
  expectations effectively."
