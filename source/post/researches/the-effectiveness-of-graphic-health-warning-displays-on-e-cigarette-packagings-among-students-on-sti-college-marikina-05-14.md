research_title: "The Effectiveness of Graphic Health Warning Displays on
  E-Cigarette packagings among students on STI College Marikina "
research_abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of graphic health
  warning (GHW) displays on e-cigarette packaging in influencing the perceptions
  and behaviors of students at STI College Marikina. Utilizing a quantitative
  research approach, the study gathered data through surveys to assess students'
  awareness, attitudes, and smoking behaviors in relation to GHWs. Findings
  indicate that while a significant portion of respondents acknowledge the
  presence of GHWs, many continue to disregard their warnings. The study further
  highlights that the design and presentation of GHWs play a crucial role in
  their effectiveness, with some students suggesting that stronger, more
  eye-catching warnings may lead to better compliance. <br><br>These findings
  emphasize the need for enhanced public health interventions and stricter
  regulations to improve the impact of GHWs. The study recommends collaboration
  between government agencies, educational institutions, and health
  organizations to strengthen awareness campaigns and refine warning label
  designs, ensuring they effectively deter youth from e-cigarette use.
