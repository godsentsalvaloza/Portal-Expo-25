  packaging in influencing the purchasing decisions of Grade 12 students at STI
  College Marikina, focusing on their awareness,attitudes, and preferences
  toward sustainable packaging. A descriptive quantitative research design was
  employed, using a survey questionnaire distributed to 69 randomly selected
  students.The study measured consumer awareness, purchasing behavior, and
  willingness to pay more for products with sustainable packaging. Findings
  reveal that 50.72% of students are highly likely to support brands that use
  eco-friendly packaging.While price and product quality remain as key factors
  in purchasing decisions, 33.33% of respondents consistently choose
  eco-friendly packaging, and 49.28% are highly likely to recommend it to
  others. The study concludes that eco-friendly packaging presents a significant
  business opportunity for brands targeting young consumers. Companies that
  incorporate sustainable packaging into their marketing strategies may gain a
  competitive advantage by aligning with shifting consumer preferences. These
  findings offer valuable insights for Businesses, Policymakers, and
  Environmental Advocates in promoting sustainable consumption through strategic
  packaging innovations.
