research_title: "Perception of Grade 12 student of STI College Marikina on the
  Cultural Significance of Traditional Jeepneys "
research_abstract: This study examines the relationship between public
  transportation, cultural identity, and community engagement to better
  understand students’ experiences with traditional modes of transportation in
  the Philippines. The study&#39;s goal is to better understand the cultural
  significance of traditional jeepneys and how they contribute to community
  relationships, as well as to discover how to preserve this crucial aspect of
  Filipino culture. We employed foreign and local studies, as well as foreign
  and local literature, to determine the significance of public transportation
  in comparison to traditional jeepneys. Methodologically, the research uses
  descriptive studies and surveys targeting Grade 12 students about what and how
  they feel about traditional jeepneys. The study investigates the students&#39;
  demographic characteristics, assesses awareness and sense of cultural value,
  compares cultural identity to daily life, and evaluates the safety, driver
  conduct, and environmental impact of traditional jeeps. Ethical considerations
  were carefully addressed, including assuring voluntary participation,
  providing explicit descriptions of the study&#39;s objective, and maintaining
  confidentiality via letter. The study emphasizes the necessity of preserving
  the cultural value of traditional jeepneys. The findings highlight the
  complicated linkages between how students wish to commute and how they feel
  while riding a jeepney.
