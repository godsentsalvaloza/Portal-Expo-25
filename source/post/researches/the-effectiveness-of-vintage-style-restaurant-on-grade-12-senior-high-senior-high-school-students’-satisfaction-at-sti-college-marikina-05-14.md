research_title: The Effectiveness of Vintage Style Restaurant on Grade 12 Senior
  High Senior High School Students’ Satisfaction at STI College Marikina
research_abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of vintage-style
  restaurant design on customer satisfaction among Grade 12 senior high school
  students in STI Marikina. It examines how elements of the interior design of
  retro-themed restaurants correlate with several factors, such as ambiance,
  service quality, and food presentation, and how these factors may affect the
  perception of students' satisfaction levels. These results contribute to the
  existing knowledge of how restaurant design influences customer experience and
  satisfaction, particularly within the context of a younger demographic and a
  specific aesthetic. By using quantitative techniques to examine survey data
  gathered from a sample of Grade 12 students at STI Marikina, the study offers
  empirical support for or against the claim that the design of vintage
  restaurants has a beneficial impact on visitor satisfaction. The implications
  of the study are relevant to restaurant owners and designers seeking to
  optimize their establishments to attract and retain customers in a competitive
  market.
