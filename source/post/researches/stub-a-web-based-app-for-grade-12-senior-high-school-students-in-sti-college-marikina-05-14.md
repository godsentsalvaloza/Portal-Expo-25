  in STI  College Marikina"
research_abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of Study Web-Based App
  among grade 12 students at STI College Marikina. Through a quantitative
  research design, data were collected through structured surveys to assess the
  experience and its effectiveness on students in terms of productivity and
  academic performance. Findings reveal that collaborative learning
  increases learning students’ confidence, encourages active participation and
  motivates the student to perform well on their academic outcomes. While many
  students find studying alone more effective, cooperative learning contributes
  positive effects and enhances motivation among students’ academic outcomes
  compared to those in traditional lecture-based learning. The study highlights
  the benefits of a web-based collaborative learning application in fostering
  teamwork and supporting student’s academic growth. Findings indicate that
  students improve their learning motivation through the use of STUB.
  Collaborative learning encourages students to engage in discussion, analyzing
  different perspective, and develop students critical thinking skills. By
  working on with groupmates, study groups which strengthens their ability to
  think and decision more effectively. An activity whereby students work
  together to achieve a shared learning goal. This method differs from the
  dominant form of instruction of lecture/notetaking used in higher education
  settings in that it requires students to take a more active role in their own
  learning versus passively receiving information from an instructor. Hence,
  collaborative learning is considered a more effective learning approach.
