research_title: The Impact of Valorant Gameplay Duration at Kadiliman Esports Cafe on the Seatwork Competion of Students at STI College Marikina
research_abstract: Playing video games over the internet is referred to as
  online gaming. It can be played with friends or gamers from all over the world
  and provides entertainment, social interaction, and competition via computers,
  consoles, or mobile phones as gaming devices. <br>Our study mainly focuses on
  Valorant, as it is the online game commonly played by students at Kadiliman
  Esports Cafe. The purpose of our study is to find out whether excessive gaming
  of Valorant at Kadiliman Esports Cafe affects the academic performance of
  Senior High School (SHS) and Tertiary students of STI College Marikina,
  specifically in their seatwork completion. A pre survey was conducted among 9
  SHS strands and 15 Tertiary courses students from STI College Marikina to see
  which students play Valorant. <br>The findings of our study reveal that
  playing Valorant does not significantly impact students' seatwork completion.
  Both Tertiary and SHS level students have reported playing Valorant, and
  despite having backlogs, they are still satisfied with their work even after
  playing the game.
