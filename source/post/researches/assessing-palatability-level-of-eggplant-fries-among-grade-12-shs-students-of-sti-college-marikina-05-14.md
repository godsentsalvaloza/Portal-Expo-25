research_title: Assessing Palatability Level of Eggplant Fries Among Grade 12
  SHS Students of STI College Marikina
research_abstract: This research establishes the acceptability of eggplant fries
  as a healthier option snack for Grade 12 students of STI College Marikina.
  Under the Quantitative Descriptive Research Design, the research tested the
  sensory attributes like taste, texture, odor, and appearance via a
  questionnaire employing a 4-point Likert scale. 100 students were randomly
  chosen to participate in the sensory test. The findings showed that taste
  (3.31–3.42) and appearance (3.19–3.35) were the factors that received the
  highest ratings, indicating that participants considered the eggplant fries
  both delicious and beautiful. On the other hand, texture (2.91–3.29) and smell
  (2.87–3.21) received relatively lower ratings, particularly on crispiness and
  the strength of the eggplant smell. The results are consistent with studies
  showing that consumers prefer snacks that are both healthy and delicious. The
  study highlights the potential of eggplant fries in the new market for
  vegetable-based snacks. It is recommended that further developments be made to
  increase crispiness and aroma. Further, research centers such as FNRI, DA, and
  NNC can also enable the production of new vegetable-based snacks for the
  promotion of healthy eating habits. Future studies can explore larger consumer
  groups and other cooking procedures for additional sensory appeal.
