research_title: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BOOKLET TITLED “MONEY SAVIOR” TO GRADE
  11 STUDENTS  AT STI COLLEGE MARIKINA
research_abstract: The study focuses on the factors that affect the financial
  decision of Grade 11 Senior high school students in relation to financial
  literacy. The researchers chose Grade 11 students as respondents from ABM,
  ICT, TOPE, And CART of STI College Marikina. The study finding shows that
  despite their knowledge about money saving, the students from Grade 11 are
  still encountering difficulties to find the precise way to manage and budget
  their money from their regular allowances.  This research paper will focus on
  the main reasons why financial education is important and necessary to be able
  to answer and help the students know and find a way to Improve and create
  changes into how they manage their money. The students may experience various
  financial problems including the lack of parental knowledge about financial
  education. The issue showed the need for an alternative financial material to
  perhaps see the efficacy of the researchers product recommendation entitled
  the "Money savior booklet." For Grade 11 students. All through the
  examination, researchers discovered that 80% of the surveys result shows how
  many students have already read a booklet about financial literacy. While 60%
  or half of the students agreed that they often see these financial materials
  about financial literacy in digital materials. The variables that can help 
  influence the Grade 11 students' financial decisions could be by the help of
  reading financial literacy materials. Another thing that plays a major impact
  in a student's choice of financial decision making is they struggle between
  managing necessary and unnecessary things. Operating and managing your money
  is a lifetime experience,  which is why everything associated with it should
  be given a proper  and serious knowledge to make good financial decisions and
  to avoid wasting your money. A lot of students are still unaware of making the
  right financial decisions because of the lack of financial education.
