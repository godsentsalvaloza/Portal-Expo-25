research_title: iFeedback Evaluation System for Senior High School Students in
  STI College Marikina
research_abstract: "This paper seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of iFeedback,
  a web-based evaluation system, in enhancing the learning experience of Senior
  High School students in STI College Marikina. Utilizing a quantitative
  descriptive research design, the purpose of this study is to learn the
  studentsâ€™ perception regarding the system's accessibility, engaging features,
  and its influence on teaching methodologies through structured questionnaires
  utilizing a Likert scale and user testing. The study's key findings reveal
  that students consider the iFeedback as highly effective for providing a
  platform for insightful feedback, receiving a 'Very Likely' rating (weighted
  mean: 3.72) for facilitating feedback and a 'Very Effective' rating (weighted
  mean: 3.66) for usability, highlighting its role in improving teacher-student
  interaction and encouraging participation through gamified elements. These
  findings emphasize iFeedback's contribution to enhancing feedback
  accessibility and the overall learning experience. This study supports the
  adoption of digital feedback systems to create a more responsive and
  interactive learning environment. The findings of this research are expected
  to benefit school administrators, instructors, web developers, and future
  researchers by providing insights into optimizing feedback processes in
  educational settings."
