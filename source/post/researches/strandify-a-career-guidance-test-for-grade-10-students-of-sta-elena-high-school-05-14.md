  can help with their future. These days, practicality is what most people
  choose rather than the comfort of their lives. Students are given a chance to
  understand their capabilities that link to their personal interest for them to
  choose a path that will help them achieve their goal with a comfort within the
  success. An online web application called STRANDIFY is created to assist
  students that are aspiring senior high school students by understanding their
  interest, capabilities, and personality that can help them choose a right
  strand path that enhance their knowledge within the specialization. The
  application is navigated by the help of a conceptual framework and a system
  framework to showcase the web application. The study surveyed 100 students
  from Sta. Elena High School to try and use STRANDIFY whether their choice can
  be affected as a study by Marjan, A. (2020) appropriate test design that helps
  students decision making can raise students interest within an application.
  This study took how aspiring senior high school students from Sta. Elena High
  School choices are affected by STRANDIFY, with an emphasis on ethical
  consideration, the use of a likert scale, a percentage and a mean as the
  instrument of the research. By the design of a descriptive quantitative
  research with a cluster technique that is used to gather informants,
  STRANDIFY, a web application can help aspiring senior high school students
  using the connection of a students' personal interest and using it to assist
  students in developing a better understanding of themselves, validating their
  curricular activities.
