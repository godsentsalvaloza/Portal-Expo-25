research_title: The Effectiveness of Organic-Based Color Palette Solvents Among
  Grade 12 Senior High School Students in STI College Marikina
research_abstract: This study focused on the effectiveness of an organic-based
  color palette among grade 12 senior high school students at STI College
  Marikina, emphasizing its safety for both humans and the environment. It
  explored the potential of organic-based watercolor as an alternative to
  synthetic ones, aiming to provide a safer, more sustainable, and equally
  effective option for artistic use. The researchers investigated whether
  natural pigments derived from blue Ternate, turmeric, and beetroot could offer
  a viable and eco-friendly solution for creating high-quality artwork. This
  study aimed to aid the quality of the organic-based color palette by exploring
  various ways to create the color palette and searching for related studies and
  articles that would support the idea in a factual way and to expand the
  understanding and knowledge about organic-based color that leads to a
  coherence. The researchers used quantitative descriptive method as a research
  design where numerical data were collected and organized in order to describe
  a certain phenomenon and simple random sampling where respondents were given a
  structured questionnaire and sample product to determine the color quality,
  pigmentation, texture, performance, and overall effectiveness. The researchers
  found out that the product produced a lighter shade because there were no
  chemicals used to produce the color. Raw materials such as turmeric, berries,
  and blue ternate are used in producing this palette which produces pigments
  that can be used as colorants. The product produced from edible natural
  resources, was safe for accidental intake since it produces antioxidant traits
  that can decrease the production of stress hormones. Additionally, the
  application of the product does not affect the paper used in applying. Lastly,
  its shorter shelf life reflects its natural, edible composition-free from
  synthetic preservatives-making it a safer, eco-friendly alternative
