research_title: "A STUDY ON THE PERCEPTION OF BICYCLE LANE SAFETY AND USAGE
  AMONG MARIKINA CYCLIST "
research_abstract: Marikina City is widely recognized as a bicycle-friendly
  city, but this reputation is best assessed from the perspective of the
  cyclists who regularly use its bike lanes. This study aims to evaluate whether
  Marikina truly upholds this status by surveying 100 cyclists within the city.
  Participants were interviewed individually using a research questionnaire and
  were given small tokens as a courtesy for their time. <br><br>Findings
  indicate that most cyclists are 24 years old and above, with the majority
  being male. While many civilians perceive bike lanes as unsafe, cyclists who
  use them report a greater sense of security. The study suggests that painted
  bike lanes contribute to cyclist confidence and overall safety, with a
  significant number of users finding them both comfortable and
  reliable. <br><br>Overall, the results confirm that Marikina remains a
  bicycle-friendly city. Despite the lack of physical barriers, its painted bike
  lanes provide a sense of safety and security for cyclists, reinforcing the
  city's reputation as a supportive environment for cycling.
