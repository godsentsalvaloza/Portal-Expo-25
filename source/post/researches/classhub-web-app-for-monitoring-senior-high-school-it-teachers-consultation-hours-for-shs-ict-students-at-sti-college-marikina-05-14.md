research_title: ClassHub Web App for Monitoring Senior High School IT Teachers'
  Consultation Hours for SHS-ICT Students at STI College Marikina
research_abstract: >-
  This study explores the development and implementation of ClassHub, a
  web-based application designed to monitor senior high school IT teachers'
  consultation hours for Grade 12 ICT students at STI College Marikina. The
  study aims to address the challenges of tracking teacher availability and
  improving student access to academic support. Grounded in Self-Determination
  Theory (Ryan & Deci, 2017), the research highlights the importance of
  autonomy, competence, and relatedness in fostering academic engagement.
  Through ClassHub, students can access real-time information on teacher
  availability, submit reports regarding teacher absence, and engage more
  effectively in academic consultations. This system aims to enhance
  transparency, facilitate student-teacher communication, and improve the
  overall consultation process. A descriptive quantitative research design was
  employed to assess ClassHub's effectiveness in improving communication,
  tracking consultation hours, and supporting academic performance. Data was
  collected through surveys distributed to Grade 11 and 12 ICT students using
  the ClassHub platform. The findings indicate that ClassHub is highly effective
  in terms of user. The findings align with previous studies emphasizing the
  role of technology in promoting personalized learning and increasing
  educational engagement.


  The study concludes that ClassHub significantly enhances the consultation process by improving the accessibility and organization of teacher consultation hours. It recommends the wider adoption of the platform across educational institutions to foster better academic support and teacher accountability. Future research is suggested to explore the long-term impact of digital monitoring tools on student performance and the potential for expanding ClassHub's functionality. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the integration of technology in education, emphasizing its role in facilitating effective academic support and fostering a more responsive learning environment.
