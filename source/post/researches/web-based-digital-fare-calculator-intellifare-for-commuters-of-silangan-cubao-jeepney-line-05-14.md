  Silangan - Cubao Jeepney Line
research_abstract: IntelliFare is a Web-Based Digital Fare Calculator that is
  designed to enhance commuting experience for the passengers of Silangan-Cubao
  Jeepney Line. IntelliFare seeks to provide an accurate fare computation and
  estimated travel time, along with discounted computations. This study aims to
  explore the effectiveness of IntelliFare in addressing commuter
  convenience.<br><br>Using quantitative descriptive research design approach,
  data was gathered from Grade 12 students of STI College Marikina through
  questionnaires assessing IntelliFare’s usability, functionality, and accuracy.
  Results indicate that most respondents suggest that the system’s ease of
  navigation, accuray in fare calculation, and improved their overall travel
  convenience. While some respondents indicate the low number of Jeepney stops
  to choose from. Overall, IntelliFare received high satisfaction based on the
  parameters.<br><br>This research emphasizes IntelliFare’s potential to improve
  Jeepney efficiency, providing a user-friendly and transparent solution for
  fare computation. Future improvement may focus on expanding the number of
  Jeepney stops, optimizing predictions based on environmental factors, and
  integrating a user feedback mechanism for continuous development.
