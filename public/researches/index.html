The presence of such facility enable the students to make their decision easily as it provides convenience, cost-effectiveness, and food variety. In STI College Marikina, there is an absence of school canteen. As such, the researchers identified the three (3) aforementioned factors that the students may use in forming their purchasing decision. The researchers developed a conceptual framework which shows the absence of school cafeteria as the cause and how it subsequently impacts the way students initiate their purchasing decision. The literature & studies reviewed for this research further supported the factors identified in this study,
highlighting the importance of convenience, price, & meal variety. The design of this research is quantitative descriptive in nature. In data-gathering, we conducted a survey in which the researchers picked the respondents through simple random sampling technique. The results of the study showed that Senior High School students of STI College Marikina prefer to buy meals outside of school as compared to bringing their own meal. Additionally, convenience stores are among the top choices of students in forming their purchasing decision. It scored the highest weighted mean among the choices in all the three (3) factors with a weighted mean of 4.2 in convenience, 3.9 in cost-effectiveness, & 4.07 in food variety.

                  data-abstract="This study examines the service quality of McDonald's Concepcion Uno, Marikina City, and its impact on customer satisfaction among Grade 12 SHS students at STI College Marikina. The research focuses on three key service quality factors: tangibility (cleanliness, ambiance, facilities), reliability (order accuracy), and responsiveness (staff attentiveness and wait times). Using a quantitative research approach, data was gathered from Grade 12 students through a survey, analyzing their dining frequency, experiences with service speed, and overall satisfaction. The findings reveal that most respondents visit McDonald's occasionally (1–3 times a month), with younger customers (ages 17–18) making up the majority. While customers generally rate cleanliness, staff politeness, and order accuracy positively, long wait times, especially during peak hours, remain a concern. The study concludes that improving service responsiveness such as reducing wait times, enhancing staff efficiency, and optimizing order processing can further improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided for McDonald's management, restaurant staff, future researchers, and other fast-food chains to enhance service quality and meet customer expectations effectively."

While 60% or half of the students agreed that they often see these financial materials about financial literacy in digital materials. The variables that can help  influence the Grade 11 students' financial decisions could be by the help of reading financial literacy materials. Another thing that plays a major impact in a student's choice of financial decision making is they struggle between managing necessary and unnecessary things. Operating and managing your money is a lifetime experience,  which is why everything associated with it should be given a proper  and serious knowledge to make good financial decisions and to avoid wasting your money. A lot of students are still unaware of making the right financial decisions because of the lack of financial education."

                  data-abstract="Mushrooms are well known for their nutritional value and meat-like texture, making them a popular plant-based substitute for traditional meat products. As consumers seek healthier and more sustainable dietary options, there is a growing interest in developing meat substitutes that are both nutritious and flavorful. However, consumer taste and texture preferences may vary, making acceptance of such alternatives difficult. This study assesses the students' preferences for mushroom nuggets at STI College Marikina, focusing on their taste, texture, and overall satisfaction with the product. The researchers used a descriptive type of survey design for the 100 randomly selected Grade 12 students from CART, TOPE, HUMSS, ABM, and ICT strands to gather information on the acceptability and palatability of mushroom nuggets. The fishbowl method was used to conduct random sampling. Respondents first tasted the mushroom nuggets and then score their satisfaction level in relation to the research questions where Likert scale is utilized to measure their level of acceptability & palatability. Findings indicate that 98.77% of students found the mushroom nuggets acceptable, with taste receiving the highest rating (3.80 weighted mean, Strongly Agree), followed by aroma and appearance (3.49 weighted mean, Agree). These results confirm that mushroom nuggets have strong potential as a plant based alternative that meets consumer expectations. Given the positive response, this study suggests that mushroom nuggets could be introduced into meal programs and commercial markets as a nutritious and eco-friendly choice. Further research on nutritional value, large-scale production, and market demand is recommended to enhance the product and promote wider acceptance."

Under the Quantitative Descriptive Research Design, the research tested the sensory attributes like taste, texture, odor, and appearance via a questionnaire employing a 4-point Likert scale. 100 students were randomly chosen to participate in the sensory test. The findings showed that taste (3.31–3.42) and appearance (3.19–3.35) were the factors that received the highest ratings, indicating that participants considered the eggplant fries both delicious and beautiful. On the other hand, texture (2.91–3.29) and smell (2.87–3.21) received relatively lower ratings, particularly on crispiness and the strength of the eggplant smell. The results are consistent with studies showing that consumers prefer snacks that are both healthy and delicious. The study highlights the potential of eggplant fries in the new market for vegetable-based snacks. It is recommended that further developments be made to increase crispiness and aroma. Further, research centers such as FNRI, DA, and NNC can also enable the production of new vegetable-based snacks for the promotion of healthy eating habits. Future studies can explore larger consumer groups and other cooking procedures for additional sensory appeal."

It explored the potential of organic-based watercolor as an alternative to synthetic ones, aiming to provide a safer, more sustainable, and equally effective option for artistic use. The researchers investigated whether natural pigments derived from blue Ternate, turmeric, and beetroot could offer a viable and eco-friendly solution for creating high-quality artwork. This study aimed to aid the quality of the organic-based color palette by exploring various ways to create the color palette and searching for related studies and articles that would support the idea in a factual way and to expand the understanding and knowledge about organic-based color that leads to a coherence. The researchers used quantitative descriptive method as a research design where numerical data were collected and organized in order to describe a certain phenomenon and simple random sampling where respondents were given a structured questionnaire and sample product to determine the color quality, pigmentation, texture, performance, and overall effectiveness. The researchers found out that the product produced a lighter shade because there were no chemicals used to produce the color. Raw materials such as turmeric, berries, and blue ternate are used in producing this palette which produces pigments that can be used as colorants. The product produced from edible natural resources, was safe for accidental intake since it produces antioxidant traits that can decrease the production of stress hormones. Additionally, the application of the product does not affect the paper used in applying. Lastly, its shorter shelf life reflects its natural, edible composition-free from synthetic preservatives-making it a safer, eco-friendly alternative"

The study highlights the benefits of a web-based collaborative learning application in fostering teamwork and supporting student’s academic growth. Findings indicate that students improve their learning motivation through the use of STUB. Collaborative learning encourages students to engage in discussion, analyzing different perspective, and develop students critical thinking skills. By working on with groupmates, study groups which strengthens their ability to think and decision more effectively. An activity whereby students work together to achieve a shared learning goal. This method differs from the dominant form of instruction of lecture/notetaking used in higher education settings in that it requires students to take a more active role in their own learning versus passively receiving information from an instructor. Hence, collaborative learning is considered a more effective learning approach."

                  data-abstract="This study examines the impact of Marikina footwear durability on customer satisfaction among Senior High School students at STI College Marikina. It focuses on how craftsmanship, longevity, and value for money influence purchasing decisions and brand loyalty. The research is based on hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis suggests no significant connection between durability and satisfaction, while the alternative hypothesis highlights its importance. The study uses a descriptive survey approach, with structured questionnaires given to students who have bought Marikina footwear. The questionnaires collected data on demographics, durability (such as performance in wet conditions and long-term quality), and satisfaction (including comfort, style, and price relative to durability). Ethical guidelines, such as informed consent and data anonymization, were strictly followed. The findings show that durability significantly affects satisfaction, with students valuing longevity and resilience as key factors in their perception of value. However, comfort and affordability also play important roles, revealing a complex relationship between product durability and overall user experience. While students appreciate Marikina's artisanal heritage, concerns about declining craftsmanship and competition with cheaper, mass-produced imports highlight challenges facing the industry. The study concludes that improving durability, along with addressing comfort and cost, can boost customer loyalty and restore Marikina's reputation as the "Shoe Capital of the Philippines." Recommendations include fostering youth-driven innovation, expanding vocational training, and emphasizing durability in marketing strategies as a key selling point."
